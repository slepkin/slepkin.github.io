## Hi, I'm Simon.

I’m an executive coach for software engineers. I started my engineering career in 2013 at Upstart, building it from 4 engineers to 400. I’ve contributed, led, and managed Product, Data, and Platform Engineering teams. I’ve created and executed an org-wide internship program and coached numerous engineers 1:1, from fresh boot camp grads to industry veterans.

I help engineers communicate effectively, regardless of their level. We can work together to:
- Protect your job, or get you to the next level
- Flourish under a stubborn, opaque, or selfish manager
- Build prestige within your company
- Rally other teams around your designs

Together we will alter how your peers and leads perceive you, amplifying your impact and advancing your career.

It's easy to find a coworker or instructor to help you write the code, but often our challenges stem from people, not technology. A good manager can help, but most managers are juggling hundreds of balls and can't spend that much time on one engineer. I've been there, and I can help you push through it.
