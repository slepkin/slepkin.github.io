## Hi, I'm Simon.

I started my engineering career in 2013 at Upstart, building it up from 4 engineers to 400. I’ve contributed, led, or managed in Product, Data, and Platform Engineering teams. I created and executed an org-wide internship program, and I’ve coached numerous engineers 1:1, from fresh bootcamp grads to industry veterans.

I’m energized by helping engineers who struggle to be heard. If you're early in your career, I can help you push through Imposter Syndrome, ask questions that get better responses, and ramp up quickly. If you're mid- or senior-level, I can teach you how to influence without authority, and change how your peers and leads think of you.

It's easy to find a coworker or instructor to help you with the technical challenges, but frequently our problems boil down to a failure in soft skills. A good manager can help, but most managers are juggling hundreds of balls and can't spend that much time on one engineer. I've been there, and I can help you push through it.
